I dedicate this page and all else to my dearly departed son, Lucas A. Maltese (1997-2019)

Hello.  I was introduced to radio at a very young age by my uncle (silent key KB2TPT) who was a commercial radio operator.  I became a ham in 1977 through a program offered by the South Queens Boys Club of NY.  K2QDY was my elmer. Dad bought my first rig; a Hallicrafters HT-32A transmitter and a Drake 2C receiver.  I worked a lot of places with that setup; first with CW, then by phone when I got my General ticket a short time afterwards.  During that time, I purchased my first handheld, an ICOM 2AT and made a bunch of lifetime friends working the local repeaters.  My first callsign was WA2MOY.

Amateur Radio provided me with the skills to work in telecommunications.  I obtained my commercial ticket with a RADAR endorsement and worked as an RF technician and ultimately in management.

I'm very active on HF with an Icom 7300 and a Wolf River Coils vertical running 100W.  The microphone is a Heil PR-781 fed into a UR6QW 8-band EQ, compressor, and noise gate.  CW key is a Begali HST3.  Radio and computer audio is mixed through a Behringer XENYX 802 into a Klipsch ProMedia system.  The power meter is a Daiwa CN-901 and the footswitch is made by DX Engineering.  On weekends, as time allows, I like taking my Jeep into parks and hiking into remote spots to work QRP CW.  On UHF, I frequent Reflector XLX013.
