<body<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>I dedicate this page and all else&nbsp;to&nbsp;my dearly departed son, Lucas A. Maltese (1997-2019)</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Hello.&nbsp; I was introduced to radio at a very young age by my uncle (silent key KB2TPT) who was a commercial radio operator.&nbsp; I&nbsp;became a ham in 1977 through a program offered by the South Queens Boys Club of NY. &nbsp;K2QDY was my elmer. Dad bought my first rig;&nbsp;a Hallicrafters HT-32A transmitter and a Drake 2C receiver. &nbsp;I worked a lot of places with that setup; first with CW, then by phone when I got my General ticket a short time afterwards. &nbsp;During that time, I purchased my first handheld, an ICOM 2AT&nbsp;and made a bunch of lifetime friends working the local repeaters. &nbsp;My first callsign was WA2MOY and I held that between 1977 and 2008.  From there, I operated as W2CLM until 2022.  Then, after 25 years in Florida, I came to the conclusion that as long as I am stuck in W4 land, I might as well get on-board.  To carry on my son's name, I took W4LUC.  It's probably the last callsign change I'll make.

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Amateur Radio provided me with the skills to work in&nbsp;telecommunications. &nbsp;I obtained my commercial ticket with a RADAR endorsement and worked as an RF technician and ultimately in management.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I&#39;m very active on HF&nbsp;with an Icom 7300 and a Wolf River Coils vertical running 100W.&nbsp; The microphone is a Heil PR-781 fed into a UR6QW 8-band EQ, compressor, and noise gate.&nbsp; CW key is a Begali HST3.&nbsp; Radio and computer audio is mixed through a Behringer XENYX 802 into a Klipsch ProMedia system.&nbsp; The power meter is a Daiwa CN-901 and the footswitch is made by DX Engineering.&nbsp; On&nbsp;weekends, as time allows, I like taking my Jeep into parks and hiking into remote spots to work QRP CW.&nbsp; On UHF, I frequent Reflector&nbsp;XLX013. &nbsp;</span></p>
